# Image Captioning with Poetic Captions
An advanced model that leverages CNN and LSTM to achieve image captioning. It generates not only descriptive captions but also poetic-style narratives for images.
## What is Image Captioning
Image captioning is to generate descriptive texts (captions) of an image. It involves computer vision techniques to analyze the images and natural language processing (NLP) models for generating a sentence that describes the image. 
## How to Transfer Text Style
The dataset we use is Flickr8k which its captions are all single descriptive sentence. To transfer the text style, openAI API is utilized.
